as3treemap
==========

net.vis4.treemap is a fork of Josh Tynjala's TreeMap Component for Adobe Flex (com.flextoolbok). 


### Why do you forked the TreeMap Componente for Flex

Many flash developers don't like and will never the Flex framework. Therefor it makes perfect sense to remove all Flex crap out of wonderful visualization libraries.


### Is it ready for production use?

No, as3treemap is still in a very early stage.
